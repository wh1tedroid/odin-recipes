    <h4>A scrumptious steak dinner, best served with free-range jelly beans</h4>
    <p>The preferred meal of Charlie Kelly, from "It's Always Sunny in Philidelphia".</p>

    <p>Only the finest cuts of beef should be used, and is delicious when served immediately, or after fermenting in the trash for a week.</p>

        <li>
            Olive (1 oliv)
        </li>

        <li>Sea water from Santraginus V (1 measure)</li>
        <li>Acturan Mega-gin cubes (3 cubes)</li>
        <li>Fallian marsh gas (4 liters)</li>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>  Take the juice from one bottle of Ol' Janx Spirit. </li>
        <li> Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V â€” Oh, that Santraginean seawater! Oh, those Santraginean fish!  </li>
        <li> Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).  </li>
        <li>Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.   </li>
        <li>Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle, sweet and mystic.   </li>
        <li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.   </li>
        <li>Sprinkle Zamphuor.   </li>
        <li>Add an olive.   </li>
        <li>Drink... but... very carefully...   </li>
    </ol>
